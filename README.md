Posts App

The Posts App is a Flutter application designed to fetch and display blog posts from the JSONPlaceholder API. The app follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern for a clean and organized codebase, and it uses GetX for efficient and reactive state management.
Features

- Fetch and Display Blog Posts: The app fetches blog posts from the JSONPlaceholder API and displays them in a list. Users can tap on a blog post to view its full content.

- User Authentication: The app integrates with Firebase for user registration, login, and logout. Users can sign up and log in with their email and password.

- Link Posts to Users: Each blog post is associated with a user. When a user creates a new blog post, it is linked to their user profile.

- User Profiles: The app displays information about the author of a blog post, such as their username or display name.

- State Management: The app uses GetX for state management, providing a responsive and reactive UI.

- Clean Architecture: The app follows the MVC architectural pattern, separating concerns and maintaining code readability.
Optional Enhancements

- Pagination: Load more blog posts as the user scrolls.
- Search Functionality: Allow users to search for specific blog posts by title or content.
- Commenting: Allow authenticated users to comment on blog posts.
- Data Caching and Offline Support: Implement data caching for previously fetched blog posts and provide offline support.

This project serves as a great example of a Flutter application that integrates with an API, uses a clean architectural pattern, and implements user authentication and state management.
